General remarks 
15. This template requires granular information on the liability structure of the entity or group. Liabilities 
are broken down by liabilities excluded from bail-in and liabilities not excluded from bail-in. Further 
breakdowns by liability classes, counterparty classes and maturity are provided. 
16. Where a maturity breakdown is set out in this template, the residual maturity shall be the time until the 
contractual maturity or, when there is an explicit or implicit, contractual or statutory, right for the holder 
of an instrument to early reimbursement, until the first date where such a right arises. Interim payments 
of principal shall be split into the corresponding maturity buckets. Where applicable, the maturity shall 
be considered separately for both the principal amount and accrued interest. 
17. By default, amounts reported in this template shall be outstanding amounts. The outstanding amount of 
a claim or instrument is the sum of the principal amount of, and accrued interest on, the claim or 
instrument. The outstanding amount due is equal to the value of the claim which the creditor could file 
under insolvency proceedings.

By default the sum of all net market values of derivative liabilities per contractual netting set. Only where
the net market value of a netting set is a liability, the netting set shall be reported. To this end, derivatives

In line with Commission Delegated Regulation 2016/140116 on the valuation of liabilities arising from 
derivatives, an additional close-out amount covering the amount of losses or costs incurred by derivative 
counterparties, or gains realised by them, in replacing or obtaining the economic equivalent on material terms 
of the contracts and the option rights of the parties in respect of the terminated contracts. 
The estimations required to determine a close-out amount in line with the abovementioned Regulation can 
prove quite difficult on an individual basis. Therefore, proxy values, which may be based on available data 
such as the prudential requirements for market risk, can be used instead. If it proves impossible to calculate
the close-out amount for the derivative liabilities, the amount reported should be equal to the amount reported 
in row 0332. 
0334

from debt instruments referred to in Article 108(7) of Directive 2014/59/EU, for which a Member
State has provided, in accordance with that paragraph, that they have the same ranking as that of

II.7 Critical functions and core business lines 
II.7.1 
General remarks 
32. The four templates of this section provide key data and qualitative assessments of the impact, 
substitutability and criticality of economic functions the group is providing, supplemented by a mapping 
of those critical functions to core business lines and legal entities. 
33. More specifically, the templates are dedicated to the following topics: 
34. Template Z 07.01 - Criticality assessment of economic functions (FUNC 1) identifies, based on 
quantitative and qualitative indicators, the non-critical and critical functions performed by the group for 
each Member State in which the group is active; 
35. Template Z 07.02 - Mapping of critical functions by legal entity (FUNC 2) maps the critical functions 
identified to legal entities and assesses whether each legal entity is considered material to the 
performance of the critical function or not; 
36. Z 07.03 - Mapping of Core Business Lines by legal entity (FUNC 3) provides a full list of core business 
lines and maps them to legal entities; 
37. Template Z 07.04 - Mapping of critical functions to core business lines (FUNC 4) maps the identified 
critical functions to business lines. 
38. Pursuant to Article 2 (1) point 35 of the Directive 2014/59/EU, critical functions means activities, 
services or operations the discontinuance of which is likely in one or more Member States, to lead to the 
disruption of services that are essential to the real economy or to disrupt financial stability due to the 
size, market share, external and internal interconnectedness, complexity or cross-border activities of an 
institution or group, with particular regard to the substitutability of those activities, services or operations.  
39. Pursuant to Article 6(1) of Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/77817, a function shall be considered 
critical, when it meets both of the following: 
1. the function is provided by an institution to third parties not affiliated to the institution or group; and 
2. a sudden disruption would likely have a material negative impact on the third parties, give rise to 
contagion or undermine the general confidence of market participants due to the systemic relevance of 
the function for the third parties and the systemic relevance of the institution or group in providing the 
function. 
40. Pursuant to Article 2(1), point (36) of the Directive 2014/59/EU, ‘core business lines’ means business 
lines and associated services which represent material sources of revenue, profit or franchise value for 
an institution or for a group of which an institution forms part’. 
41. For the purposes of this template, economic functions shall refer to the functions listed in the table below. 
42. For each category of economic functions, an economic function ‘other’ may be chosen if the function is 
not captured by the other predefined functions. 
43. Counterparties referred to in rows 0010 to 0070 and rows 0080 to 0150 are defined identically to 
counterparty sectors as provided in FINREP, Annex V, Part 1, chapter 6. ‘SMEs’ refers to SMEs as 
defined in FINREP, Annex V, Part 1.5(i).

Impact on market  
Estimated impact of a sudden discontinuation of the function on third parties, financial markets and the 
real economy, taking into account the size, market share in the country, external and internal 
interconnectedness, complexity, and cross-border activities of the institution. 
This assessment shall be expressed qualitatively as ‘High (H)’, ‘Medium-High (MH)’, ‘Medium-Low 
(ML)’ or Low (L)’. 
‘H’ shall be selected if the discontinuation has a major impact on the national market; ‘MH’ if the 
impact is significant; ‘ML’ if the impact is material, but limited; and ‘L’ if the impact is low. 
0060 
Substitutability 
Article 6(3) of Delegated regulation (EU) 2016/778. 
A function is considered substitutable where it can be replaced in an acceptable manner and within a 
reasonable timeframe thereby avoiding systemic problems for the real economy and the financial 
markets. The following shall be taken into account: 
(a) the structure of the market for that function and the availability of substitute providers;  
(b) the ability of other providers in terms of capacity, the requirements for performing the function, and 
potential barriers to entry or expansion;  
(c) the incentive of other providers to take on these activities;  
(d) the time required by users of the service to move to the new service provider and costs of that move, 
the time required for other competitors to take over the functions and whether that time is sufficient to 
prevent significant disruption depending on the type of service. 
This assessment should be expressed qualitatively as ‘High (H)’, ‘Medium-High (MH)’, ‘Medium-Low 
(ML)’ or Low (L)’. 
H’ shall be selected if a function can easily be provided by another bank under comparable conditions 
within a reasonable timeframe; 
 ‘L’ if  a function cannot be easily or rapidly substituted;  
‘MH’ and ‘ML’ for intermediate cases taking into account different dimensions (e.g. market share, 
market concentration, time to substitution, legal barriers, operational requirements to entry or expansion)

‘Application / External Portal’ 
External portals or applications provided by third parties, typically partners, to access the services 
they offered. Normally they are outside the scope of the information systems management of the 
organisation, and are installed, maintained and managed by the partner itself. Such applications 
often take the form of portals (accessible via the Internet or private networks), and despite being 
outside the scope of the information systems management services of the organisation, they are 
important (or critical) to some business functions.
