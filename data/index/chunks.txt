The estimations required to determine a close-out amount in line with the abovementioned Regulation can prove quite difficult on an individual basis. Therefore, proxy values, which may be based on available data such as the prudential requirements for market risk, can be used instead. If it proves impossible to calculate the close-out amount for the derivative liabilities, the amount reported should be equal

RESOLUTION PLANS 25 II.7 Critical functions and core business lines II.7.1 General remarks 32. The four templates of this section provide key data and qualitative assessments of the impact, substitutability and criticality of economic functions the group is providing, supplemented by a mapping of those critical functions to core business lines and legal entities. 33. More specifically, the templates are dedicated to the following topics: 34. Template Z 07.01 - Criticality assessment of economic functions (FUNC 1) identifies, based on quantitative and qualitative indicators, the non-critical and critical functions performed by the group for each Member State in which the group is active; 35. Template Z 07.02 - Mapping of critical functions by legal entity (FUNC 2) maps the critical functions identified to legal entities and assesses whether each legal entity is considered material to the performance of the critical function or not; 36. Z 07.03 - Mapping of Core Business Lines by legal entity (FUNC 3) provides a full list of core business lines and maps them to legal entities; 37. Template Z 07.04 - Mapping of critical functions to core business lines (FUNC 4) maps the identified critical functions to business lines. 38. Pursuant to Article 2 (1) point 35 of the Directive 2014/59/EU, critical functions means activities, services or operations the discontinuance of which is likely in one or more Member States, to lead to the disruption of services that are essential to the real economy or to disrupt financial stability due to the size, market share, external and internal interconnectedness, complexity or cross-border activities of an institution or group, with particular regard to the substitutability of those activities, services or operations. 39. Pursuant to Article 6(1) of Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/77817, a function shall be considered critical, when it meets both of the following: 1. the function is provided by an institution to third parties not affiliated to the institution or group; and 2. a sudden disruption would likely have a material negative impact on the third parties, give rise to contagion or undermine the general confidence of market participants due to the systemic relevance of the function for the third parties and the systemic relevance of the institution or group in providing the function. 40. Pursuant to Article 2(1), point (36) of the Directive 2014/59/EU, ‘core business lines’ means business lines and associated services which represent material sources of revenue, profit or franchise value for

---

an institution or for a group of which an institution forms part’. 41. For the purposes of this template, economic functions shall refer to the functions listed in the table below. 42. For each category of economic functions, an economic function ‘other’ may be chosen if the function is not captured by the other predefined functions. 43. Counterparties referred to in rows 0010 to 0070 and rows 0080 to 0150 are defined identically to counterparty sectors as provided in FINREP, Annex V, Part 1, chapter 6. ‘SMEs’ refers to SMEs as defined in FINREP, Annex V, Part 1.5(i). ID Economic function 17 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/778 of 2 February 2016 supplementing Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the circumstances and conditions under which the payment of extraordinary ex post contributions may be partially or entirely deferred, and on the criteria for the determination of the activities, services and operations with regard to critical functions, and for the determination of the business lines and associated services with regard to core business lines (OJ L 131, 20.5.2016, p.41). ANNEX II TO ITS ON REPORTING FOR RESOLUTION PLANS 26 Deposits Deposit taking shall refer to the acceptance of deposits from non-financial intermediaries. It does not include borrowing from other financial intermediaries, which is dealt with separately in ‘wholesale funding’. Deposits include: i) current accounts / overnight deposits, ii) deposits with agreed maturity, and iii) deposits redeemable at notice, and exclude repurchase agreements.

Lending to financial counterparties is a distinct activity and is assessed in ‘wholesale funding’. Loans includes debt instruments held by the institutions but exclude debt instruments that are securities, irrespective of their accounting classification (e.g. held-to-maturity or available for sale).

In line with FSB Guidance on Identification of Critical Functions and Critical Shared Services, the payments, clearing and settlement function is limited to services provided by banks to their clients. This category does not cover services provided by (pure) FMI providers. For the purpose of this template, FMIs include payment systems, securities settlement systems, central securities depositories and central counterparties (and do not include trade repositories).

The following shall be taken into account: (a) the structure of the market for that function and the availability of substitute providers; (b) the ability of other providers in terms of capacity, the requirements for performing the function, and potential barriers to entry or expansion; (c) the incentive of other providers to take on these activities; (d) the time required by users of the service to move to the new service provider and costs of that move, the time required for other competitors to take over the functions and whether that time is sufficient to prevent significant disruption depending on the type of service. This assessment should be expressed qualitatively as ‘High (H)’, ‘Medium-High (MH)’, ‘Medium-Low (ML)’ or Low (L)’. H’ shall be selected if a function can easily be provided by another bank

Application to classify a new instrument as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1): CRR Article 26(3) The Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) Article 26(3) provides that firms can only classify instruments issued after 28 June 2013 as Common Equity Tier 1 capital after permission is granted by the competent authority. If the regulated firm wishes to include the CET1 capital of its UK Holding Company in its consolidation group capital, then it will need to submit an application in the name of the regulated entity requesting Article 26(3) permission for the UK Holding Company CET1. Applicant firms must demonstrate that the criteria set out in Article 28 (or Article 29 if applicable) of the CRR have been satisfied. In order to facilitate review against these criteria, firms must: i) complete a CRR Permission application form; ii) complete a pre-issuance notification (PIN) form; iii) complete a CET1 Compliance Template; and iv) provide a copy of the terms of the instrument, eg its Articles of Association together with any other relevant side agreements (eg any shareholders agreement). Items (i), (ii) and (iii) are available under Key Resources below. Applications should be submitted to PRA-Waivers@bankofengland.co.uk and CRRFirms.regulatorycapital@bankofengland.co.uk. Once the firm has obtained permission for the first issuance of the instrument, the permission extends to all future issuances of capital instruments which are of the same type, and have the same characteristics as the permitted issuance. However, any subsequent issuances of the same instrument would be subject to the pre-issuance notification (PIN) requirements. For more details on PIN requirements, please see: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/supervision/capital-instruments-pre-issuance- notification Key Resources CRR Permission application form PIN Form Common Equity Tier 1 Compliance Template Effective from 1 April 2020
